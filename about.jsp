    <h3>About us</h3>
    <p>Researchers Exchange Participations is a platform for researchers 
        to exchange participations</p>
    <p>The aim of this platform is to encourage researchers participate in each others
        user studies. Moreover, recruiting serious participants has been always a burden on
        a researcher's shoulder, thus, this platform gives researchers the opportunity
        to do that effectively and in a suitable time.</p>
